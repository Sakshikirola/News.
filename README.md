## ⚙️ How It Works

1. When the page loads, it fetches the top headlines using the `top-headlines` endpoint.
2. The user can search for any keyword (like “technology”, “sports”, etc.).
3. JavaScript dynamically fetches and displays articles from the `everything` endpoint.
4. Clicking any article opens the full news story in a new browser tab.
